Local, potentially offline, Casino App for Windows 8
Local Casino
Private Casino
Offline Casino

Offline gaming
Or closed network

Card games as plugins (local and/or in-app purchase) possibly REST ability
---------------------
Texa Hold'en
Omaha
Black Jack
Baccarat
5 Card stud or what ever its called normal old-school poker

Multiple users per computer and/or multiple profices per user
- Like one user or profile per game
- or user dedicated to exploration/learning
- Default would be one user, the logged in user, with one profile with suggestions on when using more profiles.

Users should be handed like plugins to, to support AI-players and local/network users the same way,
with  future possibility for internat games (even thought thats probably unrealistic from a risk perspectice, but good when sold)

We need:
- Card images, Marker images, Dealer button etc
- Table layout, will all games be played on a 10 person board, or will it adapt.
- Card must be big/easy to read.
- Genral Settings Charm, and possibly search to show up in search for Texas etc
- Check Callisto framework for fly-out
- Support Snap and Fill modes
- Localizable?
- Plug-in style alogos for different games and different difficulties, competing algos

It must be:
- Easy to place bets, raise, put stuff in right place in a real/tournament - like way
- Must be easy to observe other players moves, with human like speed.



Future Possibility for Dice games or wheel based games
- These plugins might need different supporting functionality
